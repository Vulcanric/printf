# 0x11. C - printf
### Group project
This project is a pair-programming project aimed at writing a function that writes formatted string to the standard output stream and just as the `printf()` function, it handles ***conversion specifiers*** such as:
- `%c`: to print characters.
- `%s`: to print strings (also known as "array of characters")
- `%%`: prints the `%` character
- `%d`: which handles printing of signed integers
- `%i`: handles printing of unsigned integers
- ``
